## About

The project is made for [Brackeys Game Jam 2021.1](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-5). I took the opportunity to learn the game engine [GDevelop](https://gdevelop-app.com/). It is a really good engine for prototyping. I made the [prototype](https://senhung.itch.io/eye-and-ear-prototype) under 3 hours. Because of the lack of the experience on visual programming, I was getting slower and slower when the code expends.

## Build

1. Build from GDevelop to `bin/web` folder

2. Run post export script

```
yarn postexport
```
